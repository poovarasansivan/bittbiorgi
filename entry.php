                <p class="rr1">Bannari Amman Institute of Technology (BIT) is committed to create the Centers of
                    Excellence in Engineering, Technology and Management education having relevance to industrial and
                    societal needs. Various policies are framed considering systems, processes and procedures followed
                    in the Institute to ensure the inclusive growth of all the stakeholders associated with the
                    Institute and to "Stay Ahead".</p>
                <h1 class="heading11">Objective </h1>
                <p class="rr1">The main objectives of the incubatee entry/exit policy are to</p>
                <p class="sub-point">(1) Have a standardized procedure for the induction of new incubatees to TBI.</p>
                <p class="sub-point">(2) List all the potential sources / channels of entry to TBI as tenants</p>
                <p class="sub-point">(3) Optimize the idea evaluation carried out before incubatee induction</p>
                <p class="sub-point">(4) Make it uniform the procedure of incubatee registration to TBI</p>
                <p class="sub-point">(5) Have rules and regulations in place for incubatee exit from TBI</p>
                <h1 class="heading11">Scope</h1>
                <p class="rr1">The scope of incubatee entry/exit policy covers all the prospective incubation
                    candidates, pre-incubatees,student, alumni and public incubatees (physical and virtual) including
                    existing firms interested in incubating spin-off ideas.</p>
                <h1 class="heading11">Mandatory References</h1>
                <p class="rr1">The incubatee entry/exit policy shall confirm to the guidelines of the National Science,
                    Technology and Entrepreneurship Development Board (NSTEDB), DST, New Delhi (in terms of incubation
                    programme, incubation process, time scales, services rendered by TBI etc)</p>
                <h1 class="heading11">Policy Contents</h1>
                <p class="rr1"> Any Individual / group of people (students or general public or mix of the two) can
                    initially propose an idea (to TBI) with prime features as mentioned below</p>
                <p class="sub-point">(a) Innovativeness</p>
                <p class="sub-point">(b) Commercial viability</p>
                <p class="sub-point">(c) Technical feasibility</p>
                <p class="sub-point">(d) Social sensibility</p>
                <p class="sub-point">(e) Scalability</p>

                <p class="sub-point">(g) Energy saving / green tech intervention / value addition / low costalternative
                    (in existing product / process based ideas)</p>
                <p class="rr">TBI accepts ideas which are from diverse domains of science, technology and engineering.
                    Being in a Tier III town and surrounded by hamlets rich in natural resources, preference will be
                    given to ideas making use of such untapped / less exploited natural resources and for ideas aiming
                    to find solutions that can improve the life and living conditions of the rural folk.</p>
                <p class="rr">In a few exceptional cases (if the prospective incubatee desires so) after considering the
                    credentials pertaining to commitment, attitude and track record, the proposed incubatee (on the
                    recommendation of the Idea Screening Committee) may be given access to in-house developed
                    basket-of-technologies (concept proved), to choose one suitable technology based idea and go ahead
                    with business building.</p>
                <p class="rr">Ideas screening committee (ISC: TBI Principal Scientist, TBI manager, one technical expert
                    and one business expert) can evaluate the idea and induct the promoter/s as tenant incubatee.</p>
                <p class="rr">TBI will organize Idea fest series (Annual Event for BIT Students) and/ or Idea fair (For
                    general public / alumni / students from other campuses) as startup idea screening event(s) either on
                    its own or in collaboration with one or more event partners. Shortlisted finalists from idea fair
                    and /or idea fest series are one of the major sources for incubatees in TBI</p>
                <p class="rr">Students or general public, who could register an idea as a pre-incubation lead to TBI,
                    can opt for proof-of-concept and beyond. They (if such idea leads are proven as positive) can
                    register as incubatee firm/s with the approval of ISC.</p>
                <p class="rr">Potential future startup promoter/s recommended through BIT- Business club or campus
                    E-Cell or innovation lab can register their idea / s for incubation via ISC of TBI</p>
                <p class="rr">Registration is provided to all the tenant incubatees /firms upon submitting the following
